Focus on what professionalism means within your subject area in addition to the creative industries. Consider the following points as you write:

- [] What do we mean by the concept of professionalism?
- [] Why does professionalism matter in the creative industries? 
- [] Upholding the integrity of your industry discipline area – why bother?
- [] Professional codes of conduct – do they exist and are you aware of them for your subject area? 
- [] Try to refer to the concept of the “pillars of professionalism” in your post – “Commitment, Integrity, Responsibility and Accountability”. 
- [] Professional Codes of conduct and Ethical Behaviour – e.g., W3C Ethical Guidelines, IGDA Scotland Code of Ethics. 
- [] Respect towards your employer, peers, and clients – why is this important?
- [] Reputation matters – promoting a good image for yourself within your respective industry.
