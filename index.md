Hi there, my name is David Mould. I am currently studying at the University of the West of Scotland, on the Web and Mobile development course. I have made this blog as part of my coursework for University, however I intend on keeping it updated with some other blog pieces or portfolio work. Please feel free to contact me on my social links at the bottom of the page!
